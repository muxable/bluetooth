# muxable/bluetooth

An almost pure Go implementation of the [Bluetooth Core Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/core-specification-5-3/).

There are [several](https://github.com/go-ble/ble) [other](https://github.com/currantlabs/ble) [Bluetooth](https://github.com/paypal/gatt) [packages](https://github.com/muka/go-bluetooth),
however this package was written to support L2CAP Connection-Oriented Channels specifically, as well as not be so reliant on D-Bus and bluez.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. While the package currently does not implement the complete specification, we would be happy to add more coverage.
